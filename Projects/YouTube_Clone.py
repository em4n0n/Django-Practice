# It is not possible to create a complete clone of YouTube using only Python. YouTube is a complex web application with many features and dependencies, such as a database to store user and video data, a web server to handle requests and responses, and a user interface to display and interact with the application. Creating a clone of YouTube would require a wide range of technologies and expertise in areas such as web development, database design, and user experience design.

#However, it is possible to create a basic version of a video sharing application using Python. Here is one possible approach:

#Use the Flask web framework to create a web server and handle requests and responses.

# Use the SQLite database engine to store user and video data.

# Create HTML templates to define the user interface for the application.

# Use the Jinja template engine to render the HTML templates and insert data from the database into the templates.

# Implement the core features of the application, such as user authentication, uploading and viewing videos, and commenting on videos.

# Here is an example of how these steps could be implemented in Python:

# Import the Flask web framework and the SQLite database engine.
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
import sqlite3

# Create a Flask app.
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define the routes for the app.

# The homepage displays a list of videos.
@app.route('/')
def home():
  # Connect to the database.
  conn = sqlite3.connect('videos.db')
  # Get a cursor to the database.
  cur = conn.cursor()
  # Select all the videos in the database.
  cur.execute('SELECT * FROM videos')
  # Fetch the results of the query.
  videos = cur.fetch
