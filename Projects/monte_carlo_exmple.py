#Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical technique that uses random sampling to generate multiple possible outcomes for a given situation and then calculates the likelihood of each outcome. It is often used in finance and other fields to model complex systems and evaluate the risk and uncertainty associated with different decisions and scenarios.

#Here is an example of how Monte Carlo simulation could be implemented in Python:

# Import the necessary modules.
import random
import statistics

# Define a function that calculates the expected return of a stock based on its historical data.
def expected_return(data):
  # Calculate the average daily return of the stock.
  avg_return = statistics.mean(data['return'])
  # Calculate the standard deviation of the daily returns of the stock.
  std_dev = statistics.stdev(data['return'])

  # Use the Monte Carlo method to simulate the potential future returns of the stock.
  # Assume that the future returns follow a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as the historical returns.
  # Generate 1000 random samples from this distribution.
  samples = [random.gauss(avg_return, std_dev) for _ in range(1000)]

  # Calculate the average of the samples as the expected return of the stock.
  exp_return = statistics.mean(samples)
